# JavaScript Key Code Tester
This app is straightforward in its operation - it captures your keyboard input and displays the [keyCode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode) and [code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code) properties of the pressed key. Additionally, it includes a feature that maintains a history of the past 6 pressed keys.
